## Repo
this repo contains experiments for ranked window query over videos.

## Intro

Object detection & tracking are handled by code from `https://github.com/pythonlessons/TensorFlow-2.x-YOLOv3`

The data file (in `data` folders) is then generated by `com.interval.GenIntervalFile`.
Each line in the data file represents each frame.

## Experiments

The entry for the proposed method (handle queries with single object type) is `com.topk.Main`, which takes 6 parameters:
`data file`, `object type`, `object threshold`, `partition size`, `window size`, `k`,
`size of each partition group`(optional)

To process queries with multi object types, the entry is `com.topk.online.processors.bitset.multi.BitSetMultiTypeProcessor`

As baselines,`com.topk.online.naive.NaiveSlideWindowTimer` is the entry for single-type processing,
while `com.topk.online.naive.NaiveSlideWindowTimerMultiType` is the entry for multi-type processing.
